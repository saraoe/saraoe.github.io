I'm a PhD candidate at the department of Cognitive Science and AI at Tilburg University with [Bruno Nicenboim](https://bruno.nicenboim.me/) as my supervisor. I am working on the development of computational models of reading and sentence processing. The project will rely on methods and ideas from psycholinguistics, artificial intelligence, natural language processing, and Bayesian modeling.

### Interests

**Bayesian (Cognitive) Modeling**

- Bayesian modeling of complex behavior using Stan or brms. For my Master's thesis in Cognitive Science, I did a project on computational models of interpersonal categorization using a Bayesian workflow [[GitHub repo]](https://github.com/saraoe/bayesian_categorization).
- Data analysis using Bayesian modeling techniques. As instructor for the course Bayesian Computational Modelling, I taught Bayesian data analysis based on Richard McElreath's book [Statistical Rethinking](https://github.com/rmcelreath/stat_rethinking_2022).

**Natural Language Processing**

- Projects using methods from Natural Language Processing to detect signals in large text corpora. The emoDynamics project aimed to detect dynamics in emotion expresion in tweets [[paper]](https://ceur-ws.org/Vol-3290/short_paper4765.pdf) [[GitHub repo]](https://github.com/saraoe/emoDynamics). Additionally, I have worked on developing tools for automatic discovery of emerging (conspirational) narratives.

**Meta Science**

- How the use of informed priors in Bayesian data analysis can facilitate cumulative science. This project started as my Bachelor's thesis in Cognitive Science that a wrote in collaboration with [Frida HÃ¦strup](https://pure.au.dk/portal/en/frihae@clin.au.dk). It is now an ongoing project joined by [Riccardo Fusaroli](https://pure.au.dk/portal/da/persons/riccardo-fusaroli(3f72f2a1-e93a-4689-872c-c11c9703c1cc).html) [[GitHub repo]](https://github.com/saraoe/posteriorpassing).
- During my internship with the Computational Cognitive Science research group at Radboud University, I worked on a project on multiple realizability in relation to scientific inferences made from reverse inference in neuroscience together with [Olivia Guest](https://oliviaguest.com/) and [Iris van Rooij](https://irisvanrooijcogsci.com/).
